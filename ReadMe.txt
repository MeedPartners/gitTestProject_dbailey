This folder/directory is for my Git exploration and learning.  I start off with nothing in it but this ReadMe file.  I'll be adding other files and maybe folders in here as I go along.

To begin with, I just need to understand that I do not have to do anything other than assemble my project files and sub-folders in this top-level project folder.  I'll be devising my own project tree structure as I go along and Git should be able to handle it as it evolves.

That's all for now.
